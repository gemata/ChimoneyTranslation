## Introduction

Join us for a month of coding, learning, and contributing to Chimoney's open-source projects!

We have also introduced a [Quickstart Guide](submissions/Quickstart_Guide.md) to help you get started with integrating the Chimoney API into your applications.

## Chimoney Rewards

At Chimoney, we value your contributions, and to show our appreciation, we will be offering Chimoney rewards for pull requests that are successfully merged into our open-source projects.

- For every substantial merged Pull Request (PR), contributors will receive a Chimoney reward of $10, sent via email. Please note that minor contributions, such as typo fixes or minor fixes to other user contributions and single lines fixes will not qualify for rewards. Some issues may have specific reward amounts, which are clearly indicated in the issue labels. The amount displayed on the label reflects the payout for those specific, more complex issues.
  
- Every contributor will receive a digital badge as a token of recognition for their contribution.

- Contributors with up to 4 merged PRs will also receive a Chimoney t-shirt! Since we have a limited supply, t-shirts will be distributed based on the quality and impact of contributions.

## Obtaining API Keys

1. **Sign up for a Chimoney Developer Account:** See the Sandbox Access Instruction [here](https://sandbox.chimoney.io/developers). If you don't already have one, you'll need to sign up for a Chimoney developer account sandbox access at [sandbox.chimoney.io](https://chimoney.readme.io/reference/sandbox-environment).

- You can also check out this article on how to obtain API keys [here](https://community-chimoney.hashnode.dev/getting-started-with-chimoneys-api-chiconnect).

2. **Create a New Application:** Once logged in, navigate to your developer dashboard and create a new application. This will generate your API key for you.

5. **Start Contributing:** With your API keys in place, you're ready to start contributing!


## Project Setup

This repository contains various small projects, each using different stacks and frameworks. The code for each project is located in its own directory within the [submissions](https://github.com/Chimoney/chimoney-community-projects/tree/main/submissions) folder. You are welcome to contribute to any project or suggest your own. Here's how to get started:

- Select an issue and ask to be assigned to it. Tag @phyleria
- After implementing your contribution, submit a pull request, ensuring it follows our contribution guidelines.

## Submission Process
